3d.el - an Emacs Lisp 3D graphics playground

This is meant to be used as a toy (which may include educational
purposes): an external renderer followed by conversion from raster
into ASCII would be much more efficient, and likely it would produce
better results, while this is in Elisp and hackable.

The API is not stable, and generally this project is neither thought
through nor prepared carefully: just put together to play with, and
shared in order for others to possibly play with it as well. Best to
not use it as a dependency, at least not until some review and
refactoring.
